OpenShift Development Workshop
==============================

Introduction
------------
This workshop was created for [DevConf.cz 2016](https://devconf.cz/) to bring Developers a first contact with OpenShift Container Platform and how to start developing using it.

Most documents, links, trainings, etc. are all focused on sysadmins, which brought me this challenge to compile this content for all developers who wants to know how to get your hands dirty in OpenShift.
