Conclusion
==========

After all labs, this concludes the workshop. I really appreciate your patience for following the labs.

Please, if you think there are things to improve (there's always something that can be better) don't hesitate to open an issue in the GitHub repository or [contact me](https://github.com/rimolive/openshift-development-workshop#contact).

In addition to this workshop, I strongly recommend the free book [OpenShift for Developers](https://www.openshift.com/promotions/for-developers.html), available by the OpenShift team and O'Reilly.

Thank you so much!
