* Click `Next >`
* Click `Finish`

* After that, the CDK is added in `Servers` view. From there you can start/stop your CDK, also note that when you start CDK from the IDE it will show the `OpenShift Explorer` tab. From that view you can control your projects, applications, etc.

Lab: Configure kubernetes-lab Git repository
--------------------------------------------
* In the menu bar, Click on `Window -> Perspective -> Open Perspective -> Other...`
* Select `Git` perspective then click `Ok`. You will see that the views changed.

* Click `Add an existing local Git repository`
* Click `Browse...` and point to the location where you cloned kubernetes-lab code.
* Mark the repository and click `Finish`
* The repository is added in `Git` perspective. After that, Right-click on the repository and select `Import Maven projects...`
* Go to `JBoss` perspective
* Both `helloworld-service` and `guestbook-service` will be added in your workspace.

Since `frontend` is a Node.js application it won't be added as a Maven project, but in case you want to add follow the below steps:

* Go back to the `Git` perspective and in the `kubernetes-lab` repository expand the `repo -> Working Tree`
* Right-click on `frontend` folder and select `Import projects...`
* In the `Import projects` dialog, make sure the `Import as a general project` option is checked and then click `Next >`
* Change the project name (or keep it as is if you want) then click `Finish`
* Go to `JBoss` perspective, the new project will be shown in your workspace
