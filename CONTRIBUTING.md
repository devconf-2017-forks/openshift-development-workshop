Contributing Guide
==================
This is an open workshop, so contributions are very welcome. As a guidance for you, I prepared some instructions for two main subjects that might show up regrding the content.

Content Improvement/Adittion
----------------------------
Open an issue with the content you think it should be improved or would like to add. Make sure to add as more details as possible so we can discuss the best way to handle the issue.

Translation
-----------
To add a translation, follow the steps below:
* In the `prep-materials` directory, create s subdir containing the ISO Name of the language (I am creating a Brazilian Portuguese translation so I'm using pt-BR)
* Do the same in `workshop` directory
* Copy the contents in its respectively directories.
* Make sure the links point to the translated version.
* Translate the content. =D
